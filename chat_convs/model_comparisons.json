Here's a step-by-step guide to help you create a grant tracking system:\n\n1. Choose a platform: Determine the platform you'll use to manage and store grant information. This could be a spreadsheet (e.g., Excel or Google Sheets), a project management tool (e.g., Trello or Asana), or a dedicated grant management software (e.g., GrantHub or Instrumentl).\n\n2. Create categories: Define the categories and criteria to organize the grant opportunities. Some examples include funding organization, focus area, application deadline, funding amount, eligibility, and status (e.g., not started, in progress, submitted, awarded, rejected).\n\n3. Set up the tracking system: Customize your chosen platform with the categories you've defined. In a spreadsheet, create columns for each category. In a project management tool, create custom fields or tags. In grant management software, follow the platform's setup process.\n\n4. Search for grant opportunities: Conduct regular searches for relevant grant opportunities using various sources like donor websites, newsletters, online grant databases (e.g., Foundation Directory Online), and social media.\n\n5. Add grants to the tracking system: As you find grant opportunities, add them to your tracking system with all pertinent information, such as the donor's name, grant title, focus area, deadline, funding amount, and eligibility criteria.\n\n6. Assign responsibilities: Delegate tasks to team members, such as researching more about the grant, writing the proposal, or submitting the application. In your tracking system, assign tasks to individuals and set deadlines for each stage of the process.\n\n7. Monitor progress: Regularly review the status of each grant opportunity in your tracking system. Update the status as needed (e.g., from \"in progress\" to \"submitted\" or \"awarded\") and ensure team members are meeting their deadlines.\n\n8. Set up notifications: Configure your tracking system to send reminders or notifications for important dates, such as upcoming deadlines or follow-up actions required after a grant submission.\n\n9. Review and learn: After submitting grant applications, analyze the outcomes to identify areas for improvement. Use this information to refine your grant search and application process for future opportunities.\n\n10. Maintain and update: Continuously update your tracking system with new grant opportunities and any changes to existing ones. Schedule regular check-ins with your team to review progress and discuss upcoming opportunities.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll create an organized and efficient grant tracking system that can streamline your grant search and application process, ultimately helping your NGO secure funding for its projects."]}, "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "recipient": "all"}, {"id": "1790d3c4-31ac-482d-8d03-e1a6a97f2af7", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null}, "create_time": 1679619034.882557, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Are there any systems like these?

In our example, this physical place, our world has countries. These countries have its own policies, its own ways of onboarding users into the digital world. And in the digital world, you have different blockchains acting like different countries with their own regulations. But it's much more than the planet. So we describe it as a universe. And like when you, but you can enter into any universe and you can transfer between them. But the methods are different. When you are going there, you have to use stablecoin issuers, which themselves are kind of these entities with energies that they can distribute and they can create aid to create that energy, that money. You need physical fiat in the bank. So you send it to their bank account in our world, in normal world, physical world, physical dollars and they give you digital dollar in any of the blockchains you want. Right. So, or you can use centralized exchange, which has like entities on both realms. So they kind of give you, get from you in one of them and gives you on another. And by applying this technique, this idea to everything that surrounds us, all the money market and we can even look, we will even look at the differences between interbank and normal forex markets, forex brokers, like all exchange, all liquidity providers under them in this digital realm. So to move between the galaxies, between the blockchains in that universe, in this digital realm, what you have to do is use wormholes or like any other technology that is like wormhole. So what you want, what you are going to do is you are sending again to their wallets, these entities are trackable. You can track them, you can see what they are doing, how much they're operating, and then you have liquidity providers, right? And all that liquidity providers has its own ratio of the pool. They are working on some protocols that are placed differently from each other. And same we have here, but instead of blockchains and protocols, we do have bank systems and different ways of onboarding to them or different ways of transacting and derivatives, which are the product of that fiat money. So by combining all of this data into one single repository, data lake, we can then analyze according to different trading strategies. Depending on what you need, you will be able to get that data.

This data should be collected and updated in real-time or at regular intervals to ensure accuracy.\n\n2. **System Representation**: Convert the collected financial data into a physical representation. Each blockchain (or 'galaxy') in the digital universe can be represented as a point in space, with its position defined by a set of coordinates corresponding to the financial variables (asset prices, transaction costs, liquidity, etc.). The relationships between these blockchains can be represented as connections or paths in this space.\n\n3. **Action Definition**: Define the 'action' in this context, which could be a series of transactions or trades between different blockchains. The 'cost' of this action should take into account factors like transaction fees, time taken, potential risk, or any other relevant metric.\n\n4. **Construct the Lagrangian**: Formulate a Lagrangian function that incorporates the system's dynamics, constraints, and the cost of the action. The Lagrangian function should be designed to minimize the total cost of the action while satisfying any given constraints (such as budget, risk tolerance, or regulatory requirements).\n\n5. **Optimization**: Use mathematical optimization techniques, such as the Euler-Lagrange equations or Lagrange multipliers, to find the path of least action. This path represents the most efficient series of transactions that will lead from one state to another while minimizing the total cost.\n\n6. **Implementation**: Develop an algorithm or software tool that automates the process of finding the path of least action based on the Lagrangian mechanics principles. This tool should be able to adjust dynamically to changes in the financial data and provide real-time or near-real-time recommendations for optimal transactions.\n\n7. **Evaluation and Validation**: Test the performance of the system by comparing its recommendations with historical data or using simulations. Assess the system's ability to identify the most efficient transaction paths and the accuracy of its predictions. Make any necessary adjustments and improvements based on the results.\n\n8. **Integration and Deployment**: Integrate the developed system into your existing financial tools or infrastructure. Ensure that it can seamlessly interact with other software and tools, such as trading platforms, data feeds, and risk management systems.\n\n9. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Continuously monitor the system's performance and maintain its accuracy by updating the financial data and refining the algorithms as needed. Regularly evaluate the system's effectiveness in identifying optimal transaction paths and adjust accordingly.\n\nBy following these steps, you can build a system that converts financial data into physical form and applies the principles of Lagrangian mechanics to find the most efficient transaction paths in a complex financial environment.

So in our case, it's the universe representing the digital world or flow of the money happening in our world today. But the thing with fiat money is some of the information is not public, is not available, but we get whatever we can get and that private information somehow is reflecting on other things from which we can get the data, right? So what this means is whenever we measure the state, that is the state, like that is what we are measuring, but that is, that's not what it is because it is continuously moving, right? Someone made a transaction right after you took the snapshot of the state. So from this perspective, what we do is we match the state of whatever we have and that state is state of the universe and state of the world itself. If we know how much money is being printed every day, if we know how much of it is in future derivatives, etc., so we exclude them as they are not the real money, they are just instruments to trade, right? So they do have effect, but that effect like coming from the other things, they are relative to the asset itself and by taking that data and by taking data of the money in central banks, in normal banks, by taking the volume of like of different exchange brokers and like with this we can measure what is being traded on the centralized part of the world, right? Like for the fiat part. For example, you sending transaction to a centralized exchange, converting that to USDT and trading that is not a fiat transaction. It is a synthetic fiat transaction because what you do is you transfer your physical fiat into digital one, like in this case, TETO representing that entity and giving you like your representation of that physical cash to you and you then go and trade that physical cash representation against any other currency or you quote with it. Mostly it is being quoted by other currencies like you give Turkish Lira to get dollars, right? There are two currencies based on quote and this way, this way like then we get into the digital world where the main difference is that almost everything can be tracked. Thing is some of these things are happening inside of the protocols and the rest inside of the exchange but you can track inside of that exchange like you see how much has been minted by that stablecoin issuer, how much of it has been sent to different wallets, thus knowing like how much sits in that entity and then you go into that entity and get the data from it. Of course, you do have some constraints with it but all of them can be bypassed. Some of them easily where the API, some of them by setting up inside tools specifically designed for that web app or by working with some external data providers that already does all of that. If you need data that's not broadcasted via the API like peaks or the volatility ratio or any other trading data that most traders don't need but you need them to get the full picture, full big picture. So what we do is we track, okay, how much central bank printed this day and how much of it has been given out to the banks, what banks has been doing with it, like what banks do with it. Okay, they sent it to some of the commercial banks, they gave out the other as an aid to Ukraine, they, I don't know, gave out to the bonds or whatever. You go and track it. You see that supply of USD has been increased but its ratio to Euro, like price of dollar in Euros is not affected. Why? Because that money is not going to public that are private investments, okay? So those are private investments. So in this case, you go to the banks and track their data. You go to brokers and track their forex data and see how much, like they say that world forex trading volume is 6.6 trillion dollars. How accurate is this data? It's not, it's not. It's a data from, I don't know, from 2019, 18, from four, five years back and they don't even work on data. All, some of the big brokers, some of the big crypto companies, all of the big media companies report that data but that may be true for some day. Maybe it's bigger than that, larger, greater than that. Maybe it's not, okay? So you cannot know that. First, what you have to do is to go and track all of the money in the world. Japanese Yen, where is that Japanese Yen? Where does it sit? We will track it. How much of it in crypto, like, Lafayette's miserable amount of 0.00 something, but it will eventually happen. By the way, with the means of central bank digital currencies or stablecoin, it doesn't matter, but it will go digital. And what we are doing is we are getting prepared for that day. That already started. Maybe you have 100k volume on Turkish Lira and 300k on Switzerland Franc, but this will not stay this way. So we went out and mapped out everything in this digital realm. We mapped out how much, we will map out how much that it costs to move from one blockchain to another. We will calculate their transaction costs, how much does it cost to move inside the blockchain. And we will take assets as a metric. So for taking assets, for USD as an example, what's the volatility, what's the liquidity, what's the price, what other metrics do we have, what forces we have. Trading companies, they are forces. Some trading is a big force in this universe. They attract one thing and give out another thing. But the thing is, they do programs themselves, so they are not some sort of phenomena that can be known. But they are predictable. They do have programs. And the thing is, whenever you map everything, you will see patterns. Patterns that are forming or already formed. And then what we do is we go and analyze what pattern has been formed in the real world and in the physical world. And you know that some of it has to be or will be repeated in the digital world. But you have head start. The guys with big money, they are not interested in that because volume is low, but it doesn't matter. There are some big guys still and you can apply. And instead of country protocols, banking protocols, or other ways of moving funds between countries, what banks, brokers, you have protocols here. You interact mostly with protocols. For example, Curve, DeFi, X, Jarvis, most of them work with a curve on the back as a liquidity pool mechanism, but they do have some additional logics behind them. So we have to analyze them. Are they small? Yeah, they are very small relative to the forex, but they are the ones we do have in the centralized forex. If you believe in the centralized forex, you have to bet on these guys. Some of them will die, some of them will stay. It doesn't matter to us if we hedge our own risk. So risk management is another strategy. And if your trades are mostly no risk or minimum risk and all of them are hedged, then you can move your money freely, accounting fees and all other things. Like let's say you move two million dollars and you get six thousand dollars profit. All right, let it be. If you know for sure that you will get your money on the other hand, whenever you work with the banks, even if your licenses, everything is on place, you still have that chance of getting stuck in the system and trying to explain what were the things that you were trying to do. That can take long time, your trade can be broken and things like that. With crypto, some things are sure, like are guaranteed if you do things right and if gas prices are, let's say, even if they are high, you just have to pay high fees and you are almost guaranteed to be included in the next few blocks. With Solana, you get almost instantaneous verification time. So our end goal as an application is to gather everything, bring it back to Solana from the digital realm and offer that to the physical realm and vice versa. You can go get and tokenize some trading pairs, some trades, some potential trades of the different blockchains and protocols of them and offer that arbitrage trades as a trade to LPs and see, like, you calculate the best route to get there. You know what liquidity you have in different galaxies, you know how much of it can be used, etc, etc. And then you go and use that information to calculate the best way of offering this to investors. Like your LPs should be available 7-24, but your algorithm is the one that decides which LP you will use and how you will use it. When you need to rebalance, you can batch. When you need to execute transactions, you can batch. Like, you, we can do many things, right? Okay. Next part will be in a few minutes. Keep trading, friends.\n  - So, from this layered perspective, we have different systems, like different layers of money, which interacts with each other. Anyways, in our document, when showing different strategies, we should tell which layers are being used, which entities inside of these layers are being used, and if any kind of transformation does happen, that's what we should do.\n  - should know where on which layer their money is and they should have a map to be able to navigate between the layers.\n  - Money changers still exist today but in form of foreign exchange brokers where they change Mexican peso to Brazilian real for example. And this, one original price if they are being traded for each other or synthetic price. What that means is you take USD BRL and USD peso rate and create BRL peso rates. So this gives you synthetic rate of BRL and peso.\n  - This is our world, like until now from 15th, 16th century, we were viewing our world from the eyes, from the view of bookkeeping, assets, liabilities, dividends, profits, costs, etc. from this way. And today we have a new approach called layered view.\n  - where money are IOUs. I promise a contract to give that back.\n  - And one of the tasks is to create a balance sheet of every physical entity that holds fiat and by doing the same for the digital world.\n  - So all the money was backed by assets at that time, then they gave notes, then they gave bills of exchange, Bank of Antwerp for example started all of this, but they had clearance to give anybody any information when there were enough notes available. So what happened was the bank of Whereas with the income of 2000 pounds, now back then they were putting the notes in pockets with gold bars and stuff like that, they gave out hope\n  - Time value of money\n  - Sabit Sikinguya yahu.\n  - Newton tracked the flow of the money and created a new rate between gold and silver, like new ratio, thus making it easy for arbitrageurs to do that trades. That is what united all the world under one pyramid, with gold at the top.\n  - We must understand wholesale money and retail money in order to understand the whole system. The wholesale money is the money issued by Fed to the banks and retail money is Fed notes, cash that is being issued from the banks to retail.\n  - Fed reserves are for banks only. And stablecoin issuance is for big money companies only.\n  - The end of the 70s and the start of 80s, Fed lost the ability to calculate all money because money was divided between treasuries, repos, repository deposits that gave cash in exchange and things like that.\n  - Stocks are not securities. For example, if stocks are securities, derivatives are options, futures, and things like that.\n  - After Lehman Brothers collapse, there was a DPEC of a money market fund that supposedly must be traded at $1.00. They lowered the share to $0.97 and that is what triggered the global collapse. So this is very similar to stablecoin DPEC. So money market funds and stablecoins are very similar in a way.\n  - Bitcoin is a monetary is both monetary unit of The protocol and the protocol itself so is a terry um so but the thing is on Ethereum we have different protocols Going out of is but on Bitcoin We do have some protocols, but not as popular and not financial protocols\n  - Banks, like exchanges, act as a bank to Bitcoin and other stable coins. The thing is, banks, central exchanges, have their own account in the bank, in the physical world, but also have a wallet that holds all the digital currencies. It kind of transports you, it's a gateway for you to interact with other real arms, one of the gateways.\n- Mmf shares money market fund shares.

Here are some key points and clarifications based on the notes you've provided:\n\n- **State of the System**: Yes, you are correct. The state of our financial system is constantly changing, just like the state of the universe. Every transaction alters the state of the system. This concept is central to the idea of creating a digital twin of our financial system. Just as the universe is always in motion, so too is the financial system.\n\n- **Availability of Data**: In any financial system, whether fiat or crypto, complete data is often not publicly available. Private transactions, for example, aren't publicly available in fiat systems. However, they might impact other observable data points. In the crypto world, while transactions are more transparent, certain actions can still be obfuscated or are simply not recorded on-chain.\n\n- **Mapping the Digital Universe**: Mapping the financial universe involves taking into account all possible financial instruments, such as fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies, derivatives, etc. This would involve tracking the movement of money around the world, both in its physical and digital forms. \n\n- **Understanding the Layers**: Your notes touch upon the idea of different layers within the financial system, from the central banks (wholesale money) to commercial banks and finally to retail customers (retail money). Understanding these layers is crucial when trying to model the system.\n\n- **Converting Physical to Digital**: This is a key concept in the digitization of our financial system. Physical assets are being represented digitally, through tokens or other digital assets. Stablecoins, for example, are digital representations of physical fiat currencies.\n\n- **Interacting with Protocols**: In the crypto world, a lot of financial transactions occur through protocols. These protocols govern how transactions are processed, how liquidity is provided, etc. Understanding these protocols is key to understanding the digital financial system.\n\n- **Tracking and Predicting Patterns**: By mapping out the entire financial universe, patterns will inevitably emerge. Some of these patterns could be used to predict future movements or trends in the system.\n\n- **Arbitrage Opportunities**: The interconnectedness of the financial system means that there are often arbitrage opportunities available. These opportunities arise due to inefficiencies in the system, and can be exploited for profit.\n\n- **Risk Management**: As with any financial system, risk management is a key aspect. It's important to ensure that trades are hedged and that risks are minimized.\n\n- **Time Value of Money**: This is a fundamental financial concept, which states that money available now is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity.\n\n- **Gold Standard**: This refers to the system where a country's currency or paper money has a value directly linked to gold. With the gold standard, countries agreed to convert paper money into a fixed amount of gold.\n\n- **Money Market Funds (MMFs) and Stablecoins**: MMFs and Stablecoins have similarities in that they both aim to maintain a stable value. The destabilization of either (like the MMF share dropping below $1.00) could potentially trigger a wider financial collapse.\n\n- **Bitcoin and Ethereum Protocols**: Bitcoin is a protocol in itself with its own monetary unit, while Ethereum hosts many different protocols. Central exchanges act as a gateway between these digital protocols and the physical world.\n\n- **Importance of Exchange Brokers**: Exchange brokers play a crucial role in the global financial system, acting as intermediaries between different forms of money and facilitating transactions between them.\n\n- **Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) and Interest Rate Arbitrage**: LTCM was a famous hedge fund that collapsed due to high-risk arbitrage strategies, including interest rate arbitrage.

However, I can provide a simplified and high-level overview of the different layers and entities involved. This should be considered as a starting point and a conceptual framework which can be further refined and expanded upon:\n\n1. **Central Banks (Wholesale Money):** These are the entities that issue money (fiat currency) to commercial banks. They control monetary policy and also manage the country's foreign exchange and gold reserves. Examples include the Federal Reserve (Fed) in the United States, the European Central Bank (ECB) in the Eurozone, and the Bank of Japan (BoJ).\n\n2. **Commercial Banks (Retail Money):** These are the banks that interact with businesses and individuals. They issue money (bank deposits) to the public. They also provide a range of financial services, including loans, mortgages, and investments.\n\n3. **Foreign Exchange Brokers:** These entities facilitate the exchange of different currencies. They can create synthetic rates between currencies that don't directly trade with each other.\n\n4. **Securities and Derivatives:** These are financial instruments that represent a claim on some kind of asset. Stocks, bonds, futures, options, etc. are examples of these instruments. They are traded on exchanges, and their prices can be influenced by a variety of factors.\n\n5. **Cryptocurrency Exchanges:** These platforms allow individuals and businesses to trade cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. They provide a gateway between the traditional financial system and the world of digital currencies.\n\n6. **Cryptocurrencies and Stablecoins:** Digital or virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, that use cryptography for security. Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that is designed to have a stable value relative to a specific asset or a pool of assets.\n\n7. **Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Protocols:** These are platforms that allow people to lend or borrow funds, speculate on price movements, trade cryptocurrencies, and earn interest in a decentralized manner. Examples include protocols like Curve, DeFi X, and Jarvis.\n\n8. **Cross-Chain and Layer-2 Solutions:** These are technologies that improve the scalability and interoperability of blockchain networks. They enable faster and cheaper transactions and allow different blockchain networks to communicate with each other.\n\n9. **Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs):** These are digital forms of fiat money issued by central banks. They represent a new type of currency that combines the advantages of digital currencies with the stability and regulatory oversight of traditional currencies.\n\nEach of these layers and entities can be further broken down into more detailed components, and there are also many other factors to consider, such as monetary policy, regulatory frameworks, technological developments, and macroeconomic conditions. Additionally, the flow of money and information between these layers and entities can be quite complex and can change over time due to various factors. \n\nThis is a high-level and simplified view of the financial system, and it doesn't cover all the nuances and complexities involved. However, it provides a basic framework that can be used to understand how different parts of the system are connected and how they interact with each other."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "recipient": "all"}, {"id": "aaa27ee4-1c6e-4c40-afa2-3b03d345ff2f", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null}, "create_time": 1683841159.283413, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["If we think of money as a layered system, we need to visualize where all the fiat cash is stored in its pure form, including all the prices, quotes, bids, and asks, taking into account derivatives. In the physical part of this, we have different countries with their own rules and entities that are between these countries. As a category of money, we have wholesale money and retail. On top of this hierarchy are central banks, and beneath them are ECN actors. ECN is an actor connecting different layers. So money in the central bank layer is different from the money in the retail bank, and all of that is different from the money in broker accounts. Some of them are not even a form of money; they are instruments derived from money. By this logic, we have to map all the fiat in the world, including non-dollar markets. We then look at the flow of this money, which mainly flows into the digital realm. In this realm, money is in the form of central banking, digital currencies, stapled coins, and some other sorts that are unknown yet. In the digital realm, we have different blockchains that operate on their protocols, and almost all of them have their currency with the same name as a blockchain. To move between these blockchains, you should use technologies like wormholes or bridges, which act as a mediator of the real world connecting you or transporting your money. But you should show trust and put trust into that entity's smart contract. Besides, liquidity is fragmented into liquidity pools that use protocols. These protocols are on the blockchains, so some of them are called layer 2, and they have their set of rules, and they move some parts of the blockchain to the Ethereum protocol. Some of the protocols like Curve, DeFiX, or Jarmis are on the Ethereum blockchain itself, but they can also be on the Polygon. We keep track of that liquidity pools and how much money we have over there. That happens on a DEX, but DEX as we know it, like exchange as we know it, is different from this blockchain exchange in a way that they are mostly AMMs. Liquidity providers that are on that AMM automatically find the price. If we keep track of all of that and centralize the exchange, and in this digital part, we have centralized exchange and stablecoin issues, we do have them on the physical part too because stablecoins are the second layer of the physical cash. To have a stablecoin, you should send money into the centralized exchange account or stablecoin company's bank account, thus putting trust and making them money makers. They are like noble money makers like the Medici family was. Alright, then dollar, euro, real, Mexican peso, Japanese yen, Turkish lira all should be included in the diagram.

For example, a user might deposit fiat currency into a commercial bank, then use that money to buy Bitcoin on a cryptocurrency exchange. The Bitcoin could then be used to participate in a DeFi protocol or to provide liquidity in a liquidity pool.\n\nIn the digital realm, stablecoins act as a bridge between the world of fiat currency and cryptocurrencies, and cross-chain technologies allow for the movement of assets between different blockchain networks.\n\nCreating a visual diagram that accurately represents all of these layers, entities, and flows would be quite challenging, but it could provide a valuable tool for understanding the complexities of the global financial system."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "recipient": "all"}, {"id": "aaa25538-62f2-4587-9bd0-30877ea1769d", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null}, "create_time": 1683841396.46654, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["If we write a document/report l  with diagrams and all other data with example trades, etc., how should we format it?

Thus, transferring it to another realm, the digital realm that has its own. If we look at this digital realm as a universe, this universe has its own galaxies. Like blockchain, these galaxies have their own stars, like platform exchange, decentralized exchange, and that star has its own planets, like liquidity providers, liquidity pools. By looking at this in this way, we can apply real-world strategies to the digital world. We can track what has been sent between the real world and the digital world.

So the goal here is to look at this in this way and create some sort of visualization.\n-\n\n# Wed, May 10th, 2023\n\n- CAses:\n- ageur - depeg\n- chn marmetmaking\n- Audio memos\n  - So, in this document, what we are going to tell is that there are many business opportunities, arbitrage opportunities, like we should tie all trading strategies to real world examples and maybe have some sort of story behind them like arbitrage, when you can get into the digital world from some part of this physical place. In our example, this physical place, our world has countries. These countries have its own policies, its own ways of onboarding users into the digital world. And in the digital world, you have different blockchains acting like different countries with their own regulations. But it's much more than the planet. So we describe it as a universe. And like when you, but you can enter into any universe and you can transfer between them. But the methods are different. When you are going there, you have to use stablecoin issuers, which themselves are kind of these entities with energies that they can distribute and they can create aid to create that energy, that money. You need physical fiat in the bank. So you send it to their bank account in our world, in normal world, physical world, physical dollars and they give you digital dollar in any of the blockchains you want. Right. So, or you can use centralized exchange, which has like entities on both realms. So they kind of give you, get from you in one of them and gives you on another. And by applying this technique, this idea to everything that surrounds us, all the money market and we can even look, we will even look at the differences between interbank and normal forex markets, forex brokers, like all exchange, all liquidity providers under them in this digital realm. So to move between the galaxies, between the blockchains in that universe, in this digital realm, what you have to do is use wormholes or like any other technology that is like wormhole. So what you want, what you are going to do is you are sending again to their wallets, these entities are trackable. You can track them, you can see what they are doing, how much they're operating, and then you have liquidity providers, right? And all that liquidity providers has its own ratio of the pool. They are working on some protocols that are placed differently from each other. And same we have here, but instead of blockchains and protocols, we do have bank systems and different ways of onboarding to them or different ways of transacting and derivatives, which are the product of that fiat money. So by combining all of this data into one single repository, data lake, we can then analyze according to different trading strategies. Depending on what you need, you will be able to get that data. Latency is important. So for high frequency trading, we need a system in place that has the best speed connection to the exchange server, to the data, to the updates. If you are using any trading strategies that involves both the physical world and the digital world, and like we are tracking one and doing all the change that happens there to another or some kind of other strategy, then you should have a stable and fast access to all of this data.\n\n\n\n# Thu, May 11th, 2023\n\n- Each blockchain = state\n- Audio memos\n  -\n  - So, from this layered perspective, we have different systems, like different layers of money, which interacts with each other. Anyways, in our document, when showing different strategies, we should tell which layers are being used, which entities inside of these layers are being used, and if any kind of transformation does happen, that's what we should do.\n  - should know where on which layer their money is and they should have a map to be able to navigate between the layers.\n  - Money changers still exist today but in form of foreign exchange brokers where they change Mexican peso to Brazilian real for example. And this, one original price if they are being traded for each other or synthetic price. What that means is you take USD BRL and USD peso rate and create BRL peso rates. So this gives you synthetic rate of BRL and peso.\n  - This is our world, like until now from 15th, 16th century, we were viewing our world from the eyes, from the view of bookkeeping, assets, liabilities, dividends, profits, costs, etc. from this way. And today we have a new approach called layered view.\n  - where money are IOUs. I promise a contract to give that back.\n  - And one of the tasks is to create a balance sheet of every physical entity that holds fiat and by doing the same for the digital world.\n  - So all the money was backed by assets at that time, then they gave notes, then they gave bills of exchange, Bank of Antwerp for example started all of this, but they had clearance to give anybody any information when there were enough notes available. So what happened was the bank of Whereas with the income of 2000 pounds, now back then they were putting the notes in pockets with gold bars and stuff like that, they gave out hope\n  - Time value of money\n  - Sabit Sikinguya yahu.\n  - Newton tracked the flow of the money and created a new rate between gold and silver, like new ratio, thus making it easy for arbitrageurs to do that trades. That is what united all the world under one pyramid, with gold at the top.\n  - We must understand wholesale money and retail money in order to understand the whole system. The wholesale money is the money issued by Fed to the banks and retail money is Fed notes, cash that is being issued from the banks to retail.\n  - Fed reserves are for banks only. And stablecoin issuance is for big money companies only.\n  - The end of the 70s and the start of 80s, Fed lost the ability to calculate all money because money was divided between treasuries, repos, repository deposits that gave cash in exchange and things like that.\n  - Stocks are not securities. For example, if stocks are securities, derivatives are options, futures, and things like that.\n  - After Lehman Brothers collapse, there was a DPEC of a money market fund that supposedly must be traded at $1.00. They lowered the share to $0.97 and that is what triggered the global collapse. So this is very similar to stablecoin DPEC. So money market funds and stablecoins are very similar in a way.\n  - Bitcoin is a monetary is both monetary unit of The protocol and the protocol itself so is a terry um so but the thing is on Ethereum we have different protocols Going out of is but on Bitcoin We do have some protocols, but not as popular and not financial protocols\n    -\n    -\n    - Universe as a state representing the digital world and flow of money\n    - Fiat money information not always public\n    - Measuring state of the universe/world with available data\n    - Tracking money in central banks, normal banks, and exchange brokers\n    - Digital world allows for better tracking\n    - Analyzing patterns in real and physical worlds\n    - Working with protocols in the digital realm\n    - Risk management and hedging strategies\n    -\n    - Layered view of money and understanding different layers\n    - Money as IOUs and contracts\n    - Creating balance sheets for physical and digital entities\n    - Evolution of money from assets to notes and bills of exchange\n    - Understanding wholesale and retail money\n    - Stocks, derivatives, and securities\n    - Comparing money market funds and stablecoins\n    - Bitcoin and Ethereum as both monetary units and protocols\n  - Banks, like exchanges, act as a bank to Bitcoin and other stable coins.

In the physical part of this, we have different countries with their own rules and entities that are between these countries. As a category of money, we have wholesale money and retail. On top of this hierarchy are central banks, and beneath them are ECN actors. ECN is an actor connecting different layers. So money in the central bank layer is different from the money in the retail bank, and all of that is different from the money in broker accounts. Some of them are not even a form of money; they are instruments derived from money. By this logic, we have to map all the fiat in the world, including non-dollar markets. We then look at the flow of this money, which mainly flows into the digital realm. In this realm, money is in the form of central banking, digital currencies, stapled coins, and some other sorts that are unknown yet. In the digital realm, we have different blockchains that operate on their protocols, and almost all of them have their currency with the same name as a blockchain. To move between these blockchains, you should use technologies like wormholes or bridges, which act as a mediator of the real world connecting you or transporting your money. But you should show trust and put trust into that entity's smart contract. Besides, liquidity is fragmented into liquidity pools that use protocols. These protocols are on the blockchains, so some of them are called layer 2, and they have their set of rules, and they move some parts of the blockchain to the Ethereum protocol. Some of the protocols like Curve, DeFiX, or Jarmis are on the Ethereum blockchain itself, but they can also be on the Polygon. We keep track of that liquidity pools and how much money we have over there. That happens on a DEX, but DEX as we know it, like exchange as we know it, is different from this blockchain exchange in a way that they are mostly AMMs. Liquidity providers that are on that AMM automatically find the price. If we keep track of all of that and centralize the exchange, and in this digital part, we have centralized exchange and stablecoin issues, we do have them on the physical part too because stablecoins are the second layer of the physical cash. To have a stablecoin, you should send money into the centralized exchange account or stablecoin company's bank account, thus putting trust and making them money makers. They are like noble money makers like the Medici family was. Alright, then dollar, euro, real, Mexican peso, Japanese yen, Turkish lira all should be included in the diagram. We should explicitly show the connections between them, the flow, and then we will use different strategies to make it more visually appealing.\n  - We should focus on the profitability part and we should not forget the universe analogy that we stated in the beginning of this. We should focus on profitability and show our data architecture maybe, but the goal here is to give information about trading strategies. Also cross-chain and layer 2 solutions are different things. We should also include infographics under each text block, not each text block, but wherever possible.\n-\n\n\n-------\n\nTAKE EVERYTHING INTO CONSIDIRATION"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "recipient": "all"}, {"id": "296b3b4d-b59e-47fe-b60d-f9ec338e4533", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null}, "create_time": 1684497801.592257, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Based on the information provided in these notes, we can start to establish a strategy for both understanding and profiting from the relationship between real-world and digital currencies, blockchains, protocols, and their flow in the physical and digital realms. \n\nHere's how this would work:\n\n## Step 1: Visualization\n\nTo start, we need to visualize the monetary system as layers in both physical and digital realms. For instance, in the physical realm, we have central banks, retail banks, and broker accounts. In the digital realm, we have different blockchains that operate on their protocols with their currencies.\n\n## Step 2: Mapping\n\nThe next step is to map all the fiat currencies in the world, including non-dollar markets. Then, this mapping should be extended into the digital realm, detailing the various blockchains, protocols, and digital currencies available. This mapping should include how to move between these different areas (e.g., using technologies like wormholes or bridges in the digital realm).\n\n## Step 3: Tracking\n\nWe need to track the flow of money between these different realms and layers. This could involve tracking money flow from central banks to retail banks, from physical banks to digital wallets, from one blockchain to another, and so forth. Tracking should also involve monitoring liquidity providers and liquidity pools in different blockchains and protocols.\n\n## Step 4: Applying Trading Strategies\n\nAfter mapping and tracking, we can start applying different trading strategies like arbitrage trading, carry trading, mirror trading, local premium, and bulk premium. These strategies can be applied based on the information we've collected in our tracking, which can help identify potential profitable opportunities.\n\n## Step 5: Fast Access and Latency Management\n\nTo effectively implement these strategies, especially high-frequency trading, we need a system with a fast connection to the exchange server and real-time access to data updates. This will ensure we have the most current information when making our trades.\n\n## Step 6: Profitability and Risk Management\n\nLastly, we need to consider profitability and risk management. This involves assessing potential returns from different trading strategies and hedging against potential risks.\n\nBy combining these steps into a comprehensive strategy, we can start to profit from the differences and flows between the physical and digital realms of money.\n\nRemember, this entire process revolves around a visualization of money in a layered system. Each layer and realm has different rules and entities that interact with one another. Understanding these interactions is key to identifying profitable opportunities.\n\nRegarding the Universe analogy, you can view each realm (physical and digital) as a different \"universe\". The various layers within these realms can be seen as galaxies, each containing different \"stars\" (platforms, exchanges, banks), and each star with its own planets (liquidity providers, liquidity pools, customers). The flow of money is then seen as energy transfer between these different celestial bodies, with profitable opportunities arising when there are differences in this energy flow."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "recipient": "all"}, {"id": "9b3d81be-9630-4833-bc30-f88d15268439", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null}, "create_time": 1684510341.214391, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["We should also write what we need for each trading strategy from regulatory standpoint, from technical perspective, like which country we will use, how we will open up, how we will off-ramp, what are the fees, etc. And we can also visualize each liquidity pool by the amount they have in it."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "recipient": "all"}, {"id": "85245cea-a16b-40d5-9aa7-00e412e75923", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null}, "create_time": 1684510405.981115, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Sure, here's an outline based on the data provided:\n\n## Regulatory requirements for each trading strategy\n\n1.

Arbitrageurs often use algorithmic trading systems to execute trades quickly and efficiently.\n    - **Liquidity Providers/Exchanges**: Arbitrage traders operate across multiple exchanges, seeking to exploit differences in pricing for the same asset. Thus, they need to maintain accounts with numerous liquidity providers.\n    - **Flow of Funds**: Funds in arbitrage trading move quickly between exchanges to take advantage of fleeting price differences. An arbitrageur might buy an asset on one exchange and sell it on another at a higher price, with profits coming from the spread.\n\n2. **Carry Trading**\n    - **Technologies**: Carry traders often use risk management software to track interest rate differentials between different currencies and protect against adverse market movements.\n    - **Liquidity Providers/Exchanges**: Carry trades typically involve forex trading, so they require access to forex brokers or exchanges offering high leverage.\n    - **Flow of Funds**: In a carry trade, funds flow from low-interest-rate currencies to high-interest-rate currencies. The trader profits from the interest rate differential or \"carry.\"\n\n3. **Mirror Trading**\n    - **Technologies**: Mirror trading platforms allow traders to copy the trades made by successful traders. These platforms provide various tools to choose the traders to follow based on their trading style, performance, risk tolerance, and other factors.\n    - **Liquidity Providers/Exchanges**: Mirror trading can be done across a range of assets, so the choice of liquidity providers/exchanges will depend on the particular assets being traded.\n    - **Flow of Funds**: Funds in mirror trading typically follow the trades of the chosen successful trader. If the trader being mirrored buys a certain asset, the mirror trader's account automatically makes the same trade.\n\nFor each of these strategies, the exact details and requirements may vary depending on specific regulatory environments, available technologies, and individual trading objectives."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "recipient": "all"}, {"id": "a4efe9ea-caf3-4036-89e7-90b5e2bb9922", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null}, "create_time": 1684601294.494178, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["We can take a different approach to visualizing.

Mapping out the fiat and digital worlds and showcasing their intersection can help visualize how the flow of funds moves across different platforms and countries. Here's a broad explanation:\n\n1. **Fiat World**: This would encompass traditional financial institutions and centralized exchanges. Countries with major financial hubs like the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Switzerland, and Singapore would feature prominently. You can include key banks and centralized exchanges such as NYSE, LSE, NASDAQ, and JP Morgan, along with their respective fees and regulations.\n\n2. **Intersection with the Digital World**: This is the junction where traditional finance meets digital finance. This includes centralized cryptocurrency exchanges that allow fiat-to-crypto transactions, such as Coinbase (U.S.), Binance (Cayman Islands), and Kraken (U.S.). Here, you can illustrate the flow of funds from traditional banks into these exchanges, along with their respective fees and compliance requirements.\n\n3. **Digital World**: This includes decentralized exchanges (DEX) and liquidity pools on different blockchains. Platforms like Uniswap (Ethereum), PancakeSwap (Binance Smart Chain), and SushiSwap (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.) can be highlighted. Include the respective fees (gas fees for Ethereum, for example) and the flow of funds in the form of crypto transactions.\n\nTo represent trading strategies:\n\n- For arbitrage, you can highlight the flow of funds between different exchanges (both fiat and crypto) and different countries to exploit price differences.\n\n- For carry trades, highlight the flow from low-interest-rate fiat currencies (e.g., USD, EUR) to high-interest-rate digital assets (like DeFi tokens).\n\n- For mirror trading, show how a trader's funds follow the moves of another trader, who could be operating on a different exchange or in a different country.\n\nThe visualization will likely be complex due to the various factors at play, but it can serve as an effective way to understand the global landscape of trading strategies and the interplay between the fiat and digital worlds."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "recipient": "all"}, {"id": "528b47d7-167b-4424-8e9d-618b2878b523", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null}, "create_time": 1684601491.770311, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["We should also use fees table and different tables to calculate everything and we can show that what we need for each step to be done, what liquidity is better to have at place, and how fast we can use that liquidity, how many days does it need to flow, and then we can make another table, another graph, another database and analyze it for anomalies. What happens when normal forex markets close? When we should act to enter at right time to the digital world? What's the lag between them? We should focus on time.

For the banks, things sometimes require companies, legal companies, and we should draw the legal map also where we need private entities holding companies, and where we need operations companies, and maybe we also need a family fund to control everything, where the money is that can be controlled by the investors, and where the action operations are.

These tables would have to be dynamic and consistently updated to reflect the current state of the market. The visual representation could be a series of dashboards with real-time data feeds.\n\n2. **Temporal Analysis**: The analysis of time-lags, market hours, and the optimal time to enter the market is crucial. This could be shown using interactive charts and graphs that highlight the fluctuations in different markets.\n\n3. **Legal Map**: This is essentially a structural blueprint of the legal entities involved. This could range from holding companies to operating companies to family funds. The map would illustrate which jurisdictions they're in, their relationships to each other, and the regulatory requirements in each location.\n\n4. **Operational Structure**: This shows who controls what and where the investors' funds are.

Developing Visualizations**\n   Use highcharts or another data visualization library to create interactive graphs, charts, and maps. Sankey diagrams are excellent for showing the flow of funds. These visualizations can be integrated into a dashboard to provide a comprehensive view of the trading ecosystem.\n\n**3. Building the Web Application**\n   Deploy the application on a platform like Vercel to start testing and refining. You can use a framework like React or Vue.js to create interactive UI components for the dashboard.\n\n**4.

This will serve as the backbone of our document. It will likely need to be quite long, potentially over 2000 words, to cover all the necessary details. This part will be written in plain English to be understood by people who are not necessarily technically savvy.\n\n**Step 2: Data Collection**\nWhile the story is being written, we can start collecting data that we'll need for our diagrams and charts. This includes data on the flow of funds, the size and activity of different liquidity pools, the fees on various blockchains and centralized exchanges, and so on. \n\n**Step 3: Diagram and Chart Design**\nOnce we have our data and our storyline, we can start designing our diagrams and charts. Sankey diagrams can be useful for showing the flow of funds between different parts of the system. Pie charts or bar charts could be used to compare different aspects of the system, such as the size of different markets or the relative costs of different processes. A dashboard would be a good tool to display all these different charts in one place.\n\n**Step 4: Integration**\nThe next step is to integrate the diagrams and charts into the storyline. They should be placed at relevant points in the narrative to illustrate and emphasize the points being made in the text.

Here are the main differences:\n\n1. **FX Swaps:**\n\nFX swaps are typically used for short-term financing needs or to manage short-term currency risk. An FX swap involves two legs - a spot transaction and a forward transaction. In the first leg, the parties agree to exchange two currencies at a spot rate. In the second leg, they agree to reverse the transaction at a specified future date and exchange rate. The future exchange rate is set at the start of the contract, and the difference between the spot and forward rates represents the interest rate differential between the two currencies. \n\n2. **Currency Swaps:**\n\nCurrency swaps are more complex and typically used for longer-term financing needs or to manage long-term currency risk. In a currency swap, the parties exchange principal amounts in different currencies at the outset, agree to exchange interest payments (which could be fixed or floating rates) over the term of the contract, and then re-exchange the principal at the end of the contract. Importantly, the principal amounts are usually exchanged at the spot rate when the contract begins and re-exchanged at the same spot rate when the contract ends. This means currency swaps are subject to more significant exchange rate risk than FX swaps.\n\nIn summary, FX swaps are generally used for short-term purposes and involve an exchange of principal and a reverse exchange at predetermined rates, while currency swaps are longer-term instruments that involve an exchange of principal and interest payments and a final exchange of principal at the original rate."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "recipient": "all"}, {"id": "aaa2a501-a710-402e-97ce-a4ba3e64af8f", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null}, "create_time": 1684680486.640875, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["now summarize everything into one thing that we will forward to highcharts.

This means they experience less price volatility than other cryptocurrencies. However, their value can still fluctuate based on supply and demand dynamics in the crypto market, which can be quite volatile.\n\n3. **Counterparty risk**: In the OTC forex market, the counterparty risk is typically managed through legal contracts and regulated financial institutions. In the crypto market, counterparty risk is managed through technology (smart contracts) and trust in the issuer of the stablecoin.\n\n4. **Transparency**: Transactions in the blockchain-based stablecoin market are generally more transparent due to the public nature of blockchain transactions.\n\n5. **Speed and cost**: Transfers with stablecoins can be faster and less expensive, especially for cross-border transactions.\n\nRemember that participating in either market carries risk, and it's important to do thorough research and possibly seek advice from a financial advisor."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "recipient": "all"}, {"id": "aaa2bb30-dbf5-4cdb-92a4-9a4390dc5a44", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null}, "create_time": 1684698654.044887, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["it is not 7/24 but digital version is it is 5/24"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "recipient": "all"}, {"id": "48738874-f649-464e-9991-69fe1a45b5fa", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null}, "create_time": 1684698675.41779, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Apologies for the confusion.

This transformation is significant; money as we know it is not merely a physical entity but is increasingly taking a digital form. In this shift, a new player has emerged, solidifying its foothold in the financial ecosystem: stablecoins.\n\nStablecoins, digital currencies pegged to a reserve asset, often a fiat currency, are transforming how we view money. They play an essential role in the financial ecosystem, particularly in bridging the gap between traditional and digital finance. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, their value remains relatively steady, making them a viable tool for transactions and a harbinger of the digitization of money.\n\n## The Convergence of Traditional and Digital Finance\n\n### Comparing OTC Forex Market and Stablecoin Market\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) Forex market and the stablecoin market, despite existing in different realms, exhibit striking similarities.

The transition of money into digital formats, particularly the rise of stablecoins, is propelling a new era in finance. \n\n**2. Traditional vs. Digital Finance**\n\nInterestingly, the Over-The-Counter (OTC) Forex market bears significant resemblance to the digital stablecoin market. OTC Forex represents a considerable share of the global Forex trading volume, operating mostly during weekdays. In contrast, the stablecoin market operates 24/7, bringing in unique opportunities and challenges. Both markets represent direct trading platforms where currencies are exchanged in real-time, which greatly impacts the effectiveness of our trading strategies.\n\n**3. Trading Strategies**\n\nWe employ a range of trading strategies, tailored for both the traditional and digital financial markets. By observing the flow of funds, exploiting time lags, and understanding the financial matrices of different markets, we can apply effective tactics in both realms. Though potential returns are significant, each strategy carries its risks, requiring a comprehensive understanding and risk management framework.\n\n**4. Regulatory and Technical Requirements**\n\nRegulatory compliance is crucial to ensure smooth operations in any jurisdiction. The technical infrastructure to support these operations is also paramount. These factors directly impact the efficacy of our trading strategies and our ability to expand into new markets. \n\n**5. The Future: Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)**\n\nThe potential emergence of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) represents an exciting development in the financial world. The introduction of CBDCs may significantly alter the trading landscape, making it imperative for us to stay ahead of the curve and adapt our strategies accordingly.\n\n**6.
